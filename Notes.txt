ASYNCIO

Remainder to always await each and every asyncio "future" scheduled for running. The reason is that
if one of the futures fails and raises an exception, the failure might go unnoticed: An exception
would only be caught when accessing future.result(). If the result of the future is never evaluated,
 we might never know about the exception.

What not to do: schedule multiple futures and wait on a single one. If this future waits for an
event happening in another future, it might keep waiting forever if the other future fails. And we
would not know about the failure since we did not wait for this future.

What to do : Wait for all the futures that have been scheduled and evaluate their results. If you
don't, make sure that a future silently failing would not prevent another of your futures to
complete its task.
